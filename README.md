This is a small working model of a landing page site. Please make sure to test all your changes thoroughly on localhost before pushing to main + update this readme when you need to add more development instructions.

Regardless, you should be able to run this with:
cd frontend \
npm install \
npm run dev

and head to http://localhost:5173/

Can't wait to start working with you all!
